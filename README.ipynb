    "This project gets data about School Districts (and schools) in Oregon for the years 1997-2009 from multiple sources (https://datahub.io, https://www.ode.state.or.us), cleans, cross-correlates and analyzes them.\n",

    "    This data is downloaded as a spreadsheet from the Oregon State Education report site. The data is very unclean, with most of the columns being sparsely populated. Also, there are variations in how the school names are reported, so the data needed a lot of cleaning, and a new csv file is created.\n",
